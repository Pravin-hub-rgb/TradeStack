more about oops reversals:
Based on Manas Arora's recent discussions on X (as of mid-2025), the "indicator" you're referring to is likely his "OOPS REVERSAL indicator," which he announced publishing on July 31, 2025. This ties directly into the "oops reversal" trading setup he promotes as part of his mean reversion and reversal strategies. Below, I'll explain both the concept and the indicator in detail, drawing from his public posts and related resources.

### What is an Oops Reversal?
The "oops reversal" is a technical analysis pattern originally popularized by trader Larry Williams in the 1990s, but Manas Arora has adapted and emphasized it in his trading approach, especially for Indian markets like NSE stocks and indices. It's a type of gap reversal setup that capitalizes on overreactions to news or "noisy events" (e.g., earnings surprises, geopolitical news, or market panics), where the initial move is often a fakeout—hence the "oops" as in "oops, the market got it wrong."

#### Key Logic and How It Works (Bullish Version, as Manas Focuses On):
- **Setup Conditions**:
  - The stock or index gaps down at open (current open < previous day's close), often due to overnight news creating fear.
  - In the first few minutes (e.g., 3-4 minutes, as per Manas), the price continues lower initially, "stretching" the downside (similar to your rubber band analogy).
  - Then, it quickly reverses and trades back above the previous day's close. This signals exhaustion of sellers and a potential mean reversion upward.
- **Entry and Risk Management**:
  - Buy when price crosses above the previous close (confirmation of reversal).
  - Stop-loss: Below the day's low (the point of maximum "stretch").
  - Target: Often the previous day's high or a measured move based on the gap size. Manas notes that the level where you'd normally hit stop-loss (e.g., on a gap-down) often becomes the ideal buy point if it reverses.
- **Why It Fits Mean Reversion**: It catches "falling knives" after sharp drops (like your 15%+ over 3-8 days), but only when there's clear exhaustion. Manas highlights it for "opportunity in crisis" days, where noise causes overextension, but fundamentals remain strong.
- **Bearish Version (Less Emphasized by Manas)**: Opposite—gap up on euphoria, then quick drop below previous close for a short setup.
- **Timeframe**: Best in daily charts for swing trades, but Manas applies it intraday (e.g., first 15-30 min) on 3-min or 5-min for early confirmation.
- **Examples from Manas**:
  - #JIOFIN (July 2025): Gap down on noise, initial selloff, then reversal above prev close.
  - #NAVINFLUOR: Similar noisy gap down turning into upside.
  - Market indices (June 2025): Nifty gaps down but reverses the same day, invalidating bearish views if low holds.
- **Pros and Risks**: High reward if it snaps back (mean reversion), but risky if the downtrend continues—hence waiting 3-4 min to avoid false stops. Manas advises it for volatile stocks with relative strength, not all setups.

This aligns with his 2022 bootcamp teachings but evolved to focus on "noisy" contexts, as seen in his 2025 posts.

### The Oops Reversal Indicator
Manas announced publishing this indicator on July 31, 2025, specifically for identifying these setups on "days like today" (gap-down volatile sessions). It's designed to automate detection, helping traders avoid premature exits and spot buy opportunities.

#### Details and How It Works:
- **Platform**: Published on TradingView (common for his tools), where users can add it to charts.
- **Core Functionality**: The indicator plots signals (e.g., labels or arrows) when oops conditions are met. From available descriptions:
  - Detects gap down (open < prev close).
  - Monitors if price crosses back above prev close early in the session.
  - Updated versions (e.g., by collaborators like MalathiRaja) add confirmation: Signals only if the day *closes* above the previous day's high, making it stricter for end-of-day validation. This reduces false positives in choppy markets.
  - Includes a "breach level" logic, e.g., requiring a 1% move above the target (like prev high * 1.001) for confirmation, to filter noise.
- **Settings and Customization**:
  - Toggleable: Users can enable/disable in suites like "Manas Custom Suite" (which bundles it with his other tools, e.g., SMAs, purple dot for volatility).
  - Parameters: Likely adjustable for gap size threshold, timeframe (daily/intraday), and multipliers (e.g., 1% breach).
  - Open-Source: The updated script allows review/modification, per TradingView spirit.
- **Integration with His Strategy**: Pairs with his mean reversion scans (e.g., post-15% drops). In bots like yours, you could code similar logic: Check if open < prev_close, then if high > prev_close within first N bars, flag as oops for buy on breakout.
- **Availability**: Search for "Oops Reversal-Updated" on TradingView to add it (free for basic use). It's part of broader "Manas" indicator collections for free/essential users.

If you're building a Python bot, the oops logic is straightforward to implement (e.g., using Polygon data: if df['open'].iloc[-1] < df['close'].iloc[-2] and df['high'].iloc[-1] > df['close'].iloc[-2], signal buy). Manas still uses this in 2025-2026, per his X activity. Let me know if you want code theory for it!

### Intraday Trading on Watchlist (10 Stocks)

You have ~10 stocks from the daily scan (down 15%+ over 3-8 days, mostly red, ADR >3%). Now focus on intraday (3-min chart) for entries. Monitor from open—only trade if setup aligns.

#### Entry (OOPS-Style, Recent Evolution)
Yes, the **OOPS reversal** (gap down + price crosses above previous day's close after 3-4 min) is more emphasized lately (mid-2025 onward). He published the OOPS indicator in July 2025 for "noisy" gap-down days, saying wait 3-4 min before stopping out—sometimes it reverses, turning the low into a buy point. In 2022 bootcamp, he didn't mention this specifically; it was more "buy after gap down" as confirmation of stretch, plus big red bar, then range breakout. Now, OOPS adds confirmation to avoid fakeouts—it's an evolution for better timing.

**Simple Entry Rule**:
- Gap down (open < prev close).
- Big red candle early (body >1.5%).
- Price crosses above prev day's close (OOPS trigger).
- Buy on breakout (e.g., above big bar high).

#### Rejection Rules (Skip/Avoid Trade)
These disqualify the stock—don't force it. Common from his style:
- No gap down (or tiny gap)—misses the "stretch" for reversal.
- No big red bar early (no exaggeration/exhaustion).
- Price stays below prev close (no OOPS reversal)—setup fails.
- Breaks low (day's low or stop level)—exit or never enter.
- Low volume on reversal (no conviction)—fake move.
- Overall market weak (e.g., index not supporting)—reduces odds.

If none trigger in first 30-60 min, move on—better setups come later or next day. He often adds to winners but cuts losers fast (e.g., 2% stop). This keeps it simple and risk-controlled.
